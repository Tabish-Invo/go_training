// If you are wondering, why the above program runs well and deadlock error was not thrown.
// This is because, as channel capacity is 3 and only 2 values are available in the buffer,
// Go did not try to schedule another goroutine by blocking main goroutine execution.
// You can simply read these value in the main goroutine if you want because even if the buffer is not full,
// that doesnâ€™t prevent you to read values from the channel.
